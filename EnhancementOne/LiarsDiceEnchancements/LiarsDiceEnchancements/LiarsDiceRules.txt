Rules for Liars Dice

The first player inputs two numbers: first, how many dice on the table he or she thinks have
been rolled. Second, the number between one and six representing the value of the dice. 

All players can accept what has been called out and move on to player two,
or call player one out which will end the round and result in a winner or loser for the
round.

If player one calls out two fives it does not matter whether player one has a five or not as
bluffing is allowed in Liars Dice. It only matters if another player believes player one is bluffing
and calls him or her out on it. In that instance, all dice must be revealed. If player one is correct,
the player wins. If player one is wrong, then the player who called him/her out is the winner.
The round is then over.

If player ones call is accepted, then player two calls out a number. The first number must be
greater than what player one called. For example, if player one called out two fives, player
two must call out three or higher for his or her first number, so three fives, three fours, or
four twos would all be acceptable. One five or two sixes would be unacceptable.

Game play continues until someone is called out.
