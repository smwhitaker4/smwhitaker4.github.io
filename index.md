# Code Review
### [Liar's Dice Code Review](https://youtu.be/BnCeVtF9PVs)
The above link provides access to my recorded Code Review for the original C++ code base of the Liar's Dice application, prior to making any changes.
<br><br>

# Overview
In IT 312 Software Development w/ C++ .Net, we developed a turn-based dice game for our final project. The game I chose to do for my final project in that class was called Liar’s Dice. I chose this as the enhancement artifact for all three areas (Design, Algorithms, and Databses) because it showcases my work as a program that I built from the ground up. This means I had to interpret the rules of the game, design the structure of the code around those rules, and implement all functions according to my interpretation. No portion of this code was prefabbed by a professor or otherwise.

# Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering
### [Enhancement One Code Base](https://github.com/smwhitaker4/smwhitaker4.github.io/tree/main/EnhancementOne/LiarsDiceEnchancements)
This program was originally written in C++ which presented an opportunity to demonstrate my ability to take concepts from one program and rework them syntactically to another. The entire code base has now been rewritten using C# .Net Core. After my code review, I determined there were a few areas are of my code that needed enhancing even after the transfer to C#. I added exception handling in all relevant instances; user input sanitization was added to protect from malicious attacks; the ability to dynamically name users, as opposed to a default name assignment, was also implemented to give the user a more customized experience. Along with these changes I have set the code up with TODO comments that will be handled in the algorithm rework for the next Milestone. With these changes I feel confident that I have satisfied the enhancement portion I anticipated from Module One.
<br><br>
In the transfer of my code to C# and implementing enhancements I learned that you should assume nothing from your user. The original code base had a lot of assumed user behavior such as entering numbers where needed and that the game would be used as intended. Just because the program provided favorable results in my own isolated testing does not mean it’s impervious to error and vulnerabilities. In stepping through each line and writing the C# equivalent I tried to approach everything with the mindset of whatever can go wrong will go wrong. This helped to see more security vulnerabilities as well as enhance behavior to avoid crashing and other such poor user experiences.

# Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structure
### [Enhancement Two Code Base](https://github.com/smwhitaker4/smwhitaker4.github.io/tree/main/EnhancementTwo/LiarsDiceEnchancements)
The primary modification I performed was creating an algorithm for providing replay-ability. This changed required the maintenance of data from one session to the next which was one of the main causes for concern. I chose to implement a series of Lists as my data structures for the Player and Dice objects. Persisting data from one session to the next can add odd behavior if not handled correctly. I learned that this issue was particularly true when it came to the matter of enforcing rules of the game. After I created the algorithm that cleaned data for the next session (reset counts and clearing lists), I simultaneously opened the ability to add and remove players. Thinking I was done, I ran some test instances of the game and found out that validation for number of players could be circumvented. I had been so focused on making sure the game data would be correct in the next session that I neglected to implement re-validation of the game rules. I created logic to correct this exploit and reran instances of the game, assessing behavior with this new logic in mind. Learning that not only maintaining data integrity but validation as well was one of my key takeaways in this exercise. Ultimately, the goal to add indefinite replay capability to the game was achieved.

# Enhancement Three: Databases
### [Enhancement Three Code Base](https://github.com/smwhitaker4/smwhitaker4.github.io/tree/main/EnhancementThree/LiarsDiceApi)
Through this project I wanted to focus on a radical change that demonstrated my abilities to take a limited console application, with virtually no scalability, and transform the code to support API and database read/write functionality. This allows for the program to move towards web application capabilities, eventually including an improved user interface. The number of changes that were involved in the transfer of the console application to a web API and database integration support were extensive. The time it took to design and setup the transformation took almost as long as writing the code itself. The shift of thought process from how someone interacts with a console window versus a web interface was something I constantly had to pause and re-evaluate. Having more time in the course this application would have eventually been hooked up with a front end (likely powered by Vue.js) to provide a full web app experience.
<br><br>
The changes involving API functionality and database integration also allowed me to display some skill in HTTP responses and database security. A conscious effort was made to use dependency injection to separate secrets from my code. I’ve spent a great deal of time studying how to securely integrate database communication inside of an application, and I am eager to continue enhancing my capabilities in this area. Same goes for HTTP responses and exception handling. In a “next iteration” scenario, I would spend a great deal of time here creating smart responses for reporting back more direct errors. There’s always room to enhance projects, but for now I am pleased with the outcome of this application change.
